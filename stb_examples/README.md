The stb_examples folder contains two typical examples of how to use streamlit-book.
In order to test the examples on their own, and to avoid duplication, these are separated repos 
that should be downloaded by the interested contributor.

Methods:
```
cd stb_examples
git clone git@github.com:sebastiandres/stbook_methods.git
```

Multipaging:
```
cd stb_examples
git clone git@github.com:sebastiandres/stbook_multipaging.git
```
